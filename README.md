# capstonePimaIndians
My final project for Ryerson University created to analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
I hope to be able to use the dataset to determine which factors are prevalent in determining diabetes, thus creating less of a strain on hospitals during the time of Covid
My data set will:
Find the correlation between the given attributes
Pick the attribute I want to focus on
Complete a heat map
And finally, use test-train models to compare accuracy
